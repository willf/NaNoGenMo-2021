## The Copperhead

*The Copperhead* is a period drama directed by Charles Maigne. It stars Lionel Barrymore and Doris Rankin.

**Synopsis**: Charles Dobbins, a Copperhead sympathizer, decides to serve in Kentucky after his cousin, Blount, is killed.

After Charles is accepted by the family he falls in love with Jenny, the Drummonds' daughter, and moves to the abolitionist North with the family.

The Copperhead was released in 1957 and is
103 minutes long.

In 1864, the south’s rebellion against the Union challenged the two major questions: can a government survive if it is not supported by its people and what is the relationship between the Union and slavery. Union supporters, called Copperheads because their insignia was a copper snake, were not usually violent Confederates and the type became an increasingly known and powerful movement during the Civil War.

Charles Dobbins leaves Kentucky to become the stand-in for his cousin, Blount, when Blount is killed in the Civil War. At the duelists’ dwellings in the North, he falls in love with Jenny, daughter of plantation holders, and when the family moves to the North after the war, he lives in the North and makes a life there. Against the status quo and in its condemnation of undeclared and inhumane wars and in its contrasting of the Union and the Confederacy, The Copperhead is surprisingly still relevant given today’s climate.

As the kindly church man struggles to console the grieving widow, Clayton is revealed as a tightly-wound, but needy, butterfly who yearns to find comfort and warmth again. Alas, as the film concludes, Clayton now seems broken and deeply unstable.

Judi Swash's review of "Crooked Streets"

Here's the smartest improvisation on old-fashioned Hollywood eroticism since Jimmy Starr made with Elaine May, and the sound and the fury and the smashing and the crowing and the coughing and the coughing and the choking and the crushing and the chasing with Brian De Palma's steely conviction. Put the brakes on formula and try this one.

One of the following sentences says that, "Judi is unmarried and alone."

Judi is unmarried and alone.

Judi is an unmarried person and she is also alone.

**Synopsis**: This movie tells the story of two married people, Elmer and Katharine Berry. Outwardly, they seem happy and content with their life, but we learn they've been unhappy for years and they often fight over their lack of desire to have sex. The tensions come to a head when Elmer overhears Katharine and her lover playing racquetball and decides he wants to learn the game. Katharine agrees to help him out reluctantly and they grow closer to each other. However, Katharine is still not interested in sex and Elmer is still struggling with his wife's inconsistency.

What's the tone of the movie?

The movie is a comedy that deals with difficult and taboo subjects such as sexual frustration within a marriage.

If you were talking to a friend about this movie, what would you tell them about it?

I really liked this movie because it's a very different depiction of a sexless marriage - a totally common subject for a movie in a lot of ways, but really refreshing to see from a much more adult perspective. It deals with real issues from a much more adult perspective that can't really be dealt with by young people or given much exposure in the media in the same way. Glad to see this acknowledged in a movie.

Who would you recommend this movie to?

Anyone who deals with sexual temptation, anyone going through or has been through a sexless marriage, people who have resented their spouses in the past because of a desire for sex.

Perhaps that’s why he refuses to play a soulless soul song that landed him his nightly job at a peep show back in 1906. Being heard would starve his soul of the energy it needs. Unforeseen acts of violence catch him off guard and he is declared a monster throughout Beaumont Bay.

In 1906, mute Wallace Fitzgerald is hung from a tree for refusing to play a soul song that was sold to him. Hanging, he is declared a monster and throughout Beaumont Bay his music is remembered and revered for their freedom and authenticity.  Flash forward to 1977 where the author, Marguerite de la Motte, is hesitant to publish her book on Wallace Fitzgerald. She makes an animated short film of Wallace Fitzgerald’s time as a hole-in-one carousel trumpeter. 

Marguerite de la Motte, Wallace Fitzgerald's biographer for 1977, is hesitant to publish her book due to the social climate. The book's plot follows Wallace as he wages against trumpeter Roger Yardley and runs away with Susanna. Marguerite, with the use of animation and mixed-media, tells the story and eventual journey of Wallace and Yardley's revenge plot.

This inspirational animation weaves together interviews, archival footage and the publication's plot to tell the story of an American immigrant who lived at the birth of Beaumont Bay.
